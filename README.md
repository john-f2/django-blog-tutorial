# django-blog-tutorial
* This is a tutorial project from tutorial.djangogirls.org
* The tutorial wants you to upload your code to GitHub and use PythonAnywhere.com to pull the code and deploy the project

## Purpose 
I wanted to expand my knowledge of web development past what I knew from school. I wanted to experiment with web development outside of using Tomcat and Java. This tutorial was very helpful to get started with Django. 

## Status
• Completed <br />
• All edited .py, .css and .html files have my notes on there about Django 

## Installing

### Prerequisite
In order to run the project locally on your own machine, you first need to have python3.6+ installed. <br />
I have python 3.7 installed but if it doesn't work on an older version of python, you may need to revert the fix I used for a bug with django and python 3.7 (found here: https://github.com/django/django/commit/931c60c5216bd71bc11f489e00e063331cf21f40) <br /> 

### Running Locally
Cd into your project folder on terminal/command line and run the command 
```
source myvenv/bin/activate
```
this will run python virtualenv which contains the django dependencies. Then in the same directory as manage.py run the line 
```
python manage.py runserver 
```
this will start the server and then you should be able to access the web application locally through http://127.0.0.1:8000/
